# percolation-problem
This is a Monte-Carlo solution of the percolation problem. 
It is programmed in Java and utilises the algs4 package from the Stanford Algorithms course on Coursera.
This code is one of the programming assignments in that course.
You can set up your java environment to include the algs4 package by following the instructions here: 
https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php.
The program is run by first executing:
javac-algs4 PercolationStats.java 
and then:
java-algs4 PercolationStats n-grid n-trials
where n-grid is the dimension of the nxn percolation grid and n-trials is the number of MC simulations 
of the system.
